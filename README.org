#+TITLE: org-arbeitszeit
=org-arbeitszeit= provides a new dynamic block for Org called =arbeitszeit= (German for "working hours").
This dynamic block collects all clocked hours and provides a weekly table to quickly see your accumulated overtime:

* Installation
Currently, there's no easy method to install =org-arbeitszeit=. A version will be pushed to MELPA after the current TODOs have been dealt with. Meanwhile you can install =org-arbeitszeit= manually.
* Usage
To insert a new block, use =M-x org-dynamic-block-insert-dblock= (usually bound to =C-c C-x x=) and choose =arbeitszeit=.
* Examples
See the [[file:examples/][examples folder]].
* Todo
For the current list of todos, see the [[file:org-arbeitszeit.el::;;; Todo:][lisp source itself]].
